# Overview

Welcome to the document on the OpenNI2 SDK! The OpenNI2 SDK's exposes to the developer a comprehensive set of functionality to utilize all of the Astra's capabilities through a simple yet powerful API.

This document will be a vital resource to any developer who wants to:

- Quickly get up to speed with OpenNI2 SDK development
- Understand the high-level concepts with the SDK
- Find detailed information on specific SDK functionality or features

## Motivation

The design goals for the SDK are straightforward and lofty - to create the world's best 3D sensor development experience. To facilitate this, the best ideas from many other modern device and sensor SDKs, along with many original ideas from Orbbec's development team, were combined to put emphasis on developer creativity, remove needless complexity, and generally make OpenNI2 SDK development a joyful, unintrusive process.

## Supported Devices
